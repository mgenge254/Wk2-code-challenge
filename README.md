Here's a README for your shopping list application:
Shopping List App

This is a simple Shopping List App that allows users to add items to a shopping list, mark them as purchased, and clear the entire list. It uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the functionality.
Features

    Add Items: Users can add items to the shopping list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Enter" key or clicking the "Add Item" button.
    Mark as Purchased: Users can click on an item in the list to toggle the "purchased" status, which visually marks it as completed.
    Clear List: Users can clear the entire shopping list with a button click.
    Persistent List: Each item includes its name and purchase status (purchased or not purchased).

## How It Works

    Input Field: The user enters the name of the shopping item into an input field.
    Add Item: The item is added to the shopping list when the user presses "Enter" or clicks the "Add Item" button.
    Toggle Purchased Status: Clicking on a list item will toggle its purchased status. The item will have a line-through style when marked as purchased.
    Clear List: The "Clear List" button will remove all items from the shopping list.
